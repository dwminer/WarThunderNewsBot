**About**

This bot crawls warthunder.com/news for news items and posts them to reddit.com/r/warthunder.

When it submits a news item or finds an existing submission, it fetches the article and scrapes it for text, links, images, and embedded content. This is then "translated" to the format of a Reddit comment and posted in the comments section.

This probably isn't that useful in other contexts, but it can be configured to run on different user accounts and subreddits simply by changing the username and subreddit variables.
